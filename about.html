                            <p class="custom-font">Yuranka Games is more than just a store; it's a passion project born from our love for Trading Card Games (TCGs) and a deep-rooted nostalgia for the days when children had "third places" to engage in non-sports related activities. What began as a haven for TCG enthusiasts has blossomed into a diverse gaming paradise. Today, we proudly offer a wide array of entertainment options, including board games, video games, and tabletop gaming, along with exciting events for all ages. At Yuranka Games, we're not just selling games; we're cultivating a community and keeping the spirit of play alive for generations to come.</p>

                                <li class="policy-item">
                                    <div class="policy-header">Return Policy</div>
                                    <div class="policy-content">We have a 14-day return policy, which means you have 14 days after receiving your item to request a return.
                                        To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You'll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
                                        To start a return, you can contact us at support@yuranka.com. Please note that returns will need to be sent to the address put on our contact us page.
                                        If your return is accepted, we'll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
                                        You can always contact us for any return question at support@yuranka.com.
                                        Damages and Issues
                                        Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
                                        Exceptions / Non-Returnable Items
                                        Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders or personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty products). We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns about your specific item.
                                        Exchanges
                                        The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.
                                        European Union 14-Day Cooling-Off Period
                                        Notwithstanding the above, if the merchandise is being shipped into the European Union, you have the right to cancel or return your order within 14 days, for any reason and without a justification. Your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You'll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
                                        For limited edition items returned under the EU 14-day cooling-off period: While the right to return remains unaffected by market price fluctuations, any breaking of seals or signs of use may result in a reduction of the refund amount to reflect the item's diminished value as a collectible. Full refunds are only provided for items returned in their original factory-sealed condition.
                                        Refunds
                                        We will notify you once we've received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you'll be automatically refunded on your original payment method within 20 business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.
                                        If more than 15 business days have passed since we've approved your return, please contact us at support@yuranka.com.
                                        Pre-Order and Deposit Policy
                                        When you place a deposit for a limited edition item, you are authorizing us to purchase the item on your behalf from our suppliers. Please note:
                                        Deposits secure your allocation from a limited quantity of items
                                        Once we submit orders to our suppliers, deposits become non-refundable as we have made financial commitments on your behalf
                                        While we guarantee that your item will be secured, delivery timelines may vary due to factors beyond our control
                                        We actively manage all orders and will take necessary steps to retrieve your items
                                        We will keep you informed of any significant delays or changes to expected delivery dates
                                        Force majeure events (such as global shipping disruptions, natural disasters, etc.) may impact delivery timelines
                                        By placing a deposit, you acknowledge and accept that:
                                        Delivery dates are estimates and subject to change
                                        We cannot provide exact delivery timeframes due to variables in the supply chain
                                        Your allocation is guaranteed, but the timeline for receiving it may vary
                                        We will maintain communication regarding the status of your order
                                        Important Note on Return Condition and Packaging
                                        To ensure a smooth return process and avoid any deductions from your refund, please return items in their original condition and packaging. For collectible items (such as TCG products), the item must be in its original factory-sealed condition - this means the product's own seal must be intact and unbroken. The outer shipping box or delivery packaging is not considered part of the original sealed condition.
                                        Any items with broken seals, signs of opening, tampering, or damage will either be:
                                        Ineligible for return
                                        Subject to a significant reduction in refund value due to the loss of collectible status

                                        How We Disclose Personal Information
                                        In certain circumstances, we may disclose your personal information to third parties for legitimate purposes subject to this Privacy Policy. Such circumstances may include:
                                        With vendors or other third parties who perform services on our behalf, including:
                                        Shopify for our e-commerce platform (processing orders, payments, and store management)
                                        GoDaddy for web hosting services and infrastructure

                                        Payment processors, fulfillment partners, and customer support providers
                                        These service providers are only authorized to use your personal information as necessary to provide services to us and are required to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data they process.
                                        Children's Data
                                        The Services are not intended to be used by children, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children. During registration, users must confirm they are either above 18 years of age or have parental permission by checking a mandatory checkbox. If you are the parent or guardian of a child who has provided us with their personal information, you may contact us using the contact details set out below to request that it be deleted.
                                        Despite these precautions, if we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under age 18 without appropriate parental consent, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 18 without proper consent, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided in this policy.
                                        Security and Retention of Your Information
                                        Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee "perfect security." In addition, any information you send to us may not be secure while in transit. We recommend that you do not use unsecure channels to communicate sensitive or confidential information to us.
                                        How long we retain your personal information depends on different factors, such as whether we need the information to maintain your account, to provide the Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce other applicable contracts and policies.
                                        International Data Transfers
                                        We use service providers based around the world to provide you with our Services. This means that your personal information may be transferred to and processed in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including:
                                        The United States (for services provided by Google, Heroku, and GoDaddy)
                                        Other countries where our service providers may operate
                                        When we transfer your data outside the EEA, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, including:
                                        Relying on European Commission adequacy decisions where applicable
                                        Using Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission
                                        Implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information
                                        You can request more information about these safeguards by contacting us using the details provided in the Contact section of this policy.
